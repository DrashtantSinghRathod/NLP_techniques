Assignment 1:

roll.no-> 22111059(Sudiksha Navik)



Implementation:

We performed unicode correction by having some if else statements on the 
natural unicode.
After each consonant add à¤… but not for consonant with halant
Halant is added to consonant by adding chr(2381)

Syllable are extracted by  vowel sound ending.

precision=truepositive/(truepositive+falsepositive)

recall=truepositive/(truepositive+falsenegative)

F-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Q7(b) mark the suffix ones that are correct;
    => from the data of frequency itself we find that the string
     which are not suffix are having very less frequency 
     

Assumptions:

    Code size must be in range 1GB


Limitations:

    Due to large file code may take large time to give output.

all questions are uploaded in same ipynb notebook.
